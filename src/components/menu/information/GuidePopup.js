                <div className='guide-section'>
                  <b>A: Set Up Integrations and Devices</b>
                  <p>Inside Home Assistant operating system, there is the main menu on the lefthand side of the screen. You can access adding devices and integrations through 
                    <b> Settings â†’ Devices & Services</b>. The integration is what is necessary to link your devices to Home Assistant. Under the integrations tab, you can click "Add Integration".
                    From the popup, search for <i>The Things Network</i> or <i>ZigBee Home Integration</i></p>

                    <u>The Things Network</u>
                    <p>The Things Network is an integration that allows utilization of LoRaWAN devices. You must access and setup your devices <a href="https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">
                  here </a> before proceeding. Once you create an account, set your credentials, and link your devices, you can proceed by generating an API key. This is a communication key that allows you to
                  link your TheThingsNetwork devices to other software. <a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/thethingsnetwork/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">
                  Home Assistant provides a guide for setting up the API key.</a></p>
                  <p>Once you're fully set up, you will have a <b>host, application ID, and API key.</b> TheThingsNetwork integration popup will require these three requirements, as seen below.</p>

                  <img src={TheThingsNetwork} alt='TheThingsNetwork integration popup in Home Assistant' style={{width: '400px'}}></img>

                  <u>ZigBee</u>
                  <p> ZigBee devices require a coordinator or hub that can directly communicate with the Home Assistant platform. These devices will be placed throughout a home and communicate with one another,
                    linking in what is known as a mesh network. You can setup your ZigBee devices by utilizing the <b>Zigbee Home Integration</b> by searching for it in the add integration menu. You will be prompted
                    to enter your ZigBee radio coordinator information. <a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/zha/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">
                  Please refer to the in depth guide by Home Assistant to help set up your ZigBee devices.</a>

                <div className='guide-section'>
                  <b>B: Access Core Configuration Files</b>
                  <p>Home Assistant stores all of it's configurations within it's storage file. For this Smart Floor Planner, the <b>Device and Entity registries are most important.</b> The main types of files are: </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li><b>Device Registry:</b> devices, such as each multisensor</li>
                    <li><b>Entity Registry:</b> sensors or entities, such as each sensor in a multisensor, or various entities used for dashboard customization</li>
                    <li><b>Floor Registry:</b> each floor inside a home</li>
                    <li><b>Area Registry:</b> each room inside a home, marked by the different floors</li>
                    <li><b>Label Registry:</b> labels assigned to devices or entities to perform specific purposes</li>
                    <li><b>Lovelace:</b> the files that make up the various dashboards in Home Assistant</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p> Smart Floor Planner will take the device and entity registry to synchronize your devices to a floorplan. You can add your target devices, configure them,
                    then export the data. All of the above files will be created for which you can upload back into Home Assistant, as seen in <b> Step 3</b>.
                  </p>

                  <u>Access files</u>
                  <p>In order to access the files from the Home Assistant OS, you must install an add-on. As Home Assistant is open source software, there are dozens of libraries that can be utilized to improve
                  usage and customization. A file editor allows you to access the important files for Home Assistant. </p>
                  <p> You can install the <i>file editor</i> add-on by navigating to <b> Settings â†’ Add-ons â†’ Add-on Store</b>. Once you're in the store, search for "file editor" and install.
                  Be sure to select "start on boot" and "show on sidebar". </p>
                  <p>To access the core configuration files, you must enable access to Home Assistant storage. On the file editor installation screen, you will see "Info, Documentation, Configuration, and Log"
                    at the top of your screen. Please select "Configuration" where you will be met with this screen: </p>

                  <p>Above the <i>ignore pattern</i> section, there are a few text bubbles. These bubbles are various folders hidden by default. Click the x on the ".storage" bubble to access this folder in the file
                  editor. You can now proceed to the file editor, which should be on the sidebar menu</p>
                  <p>Once inside the file editor, click the folder icon on the top-left of the screen. This triggers the file view. Navigate to <b>.storage</b>. Once inside this folder,
                  search for <b>core.device_registry</b> and <b>core.entity_registry</b>. Click on the three dots next to these two files and download them. Once downloaded, you can proceed to section C.</p>

                  <b>C: Upload Files to Smart Floor Planner</b>
                  <p>Now that you have the <b>core.device_registry</b> and <b>core.entity_registry</b>, you can upload them to Smart Floor Planner. In the top menu, please select
                  <i>Add Sensor</i>. Please note that you must have an active canvas in order to access the button.</p>
                  <p>Click on Add Devices, then you will be brought to a popup screen asking for the device and entity registry. Simply upload both of these files, then click Generate Sensors.
                  Once generated, you will have access to your LoRaWAN devices and ZigBee devices. You can select on your desired devices to access their configuration menu and add them to your floor plan.</p>

                      <li><b>Sensor Name:</b> The name of the sensor. Similar to device name, it can be renamed by clicking and entering a new name.</li>
                      <li><b>Active Sensor:</b> This checkbox is for setting the sensor as an active sensor. This will be used to visualize data in a generated dashboard in Home Assistant through exporting. This is useful in the case of
                        using a multisensor with several sensors but you only want to view the temperature sensor.</li>
                      <li><b>Sensor Type:</b> The type of data each sensor collects. Certain sensor types, such as binary, can be changed by clicking and selecting what you wish to view. For example,
                      binary sensors registor a 1 or 0, which can be useful in instances of checking whether a door or window is opened or closed.</li>
                      <li><b>Sensor Label:</b> This is the label attributed to each sensor, which can be utilized for specific data tracking. Location can log a person's location over time, activity logs the amount of
                      time used for certain activities such as watching TV, and ambient tracks conditions of the home. You can create a new label by clicking "add label". The ability to add multiple labels to one entity
